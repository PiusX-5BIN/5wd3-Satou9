        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>Graphics refer to sketches, drawings, or specialized networks that visually convey meaningful information. Computer Graphics involves manipulating sets of images or creating pixel-based images on a computer. It finds applications in digital photography, film, entertainment, electronic devices, and other essential technologies. This field, encompassing various aspects, is extensive within computer science. Computer Graphics finds application in UI design, rendering, geometric objects, animation, and more. In many contexts, Computer Graphics is abbreviated as CG. Several tools are utilized for implementing Computer Graphics, including the fundamental <graphics.h> header file in Turbo-C, the advanced Unity framework, and even OpenGL.

        <h3>There are several types of graphics commonly used in various fields. Here are some of the main types: </h3>    
        <p>Raster Graphics: Also known as bitmap graphics, these graphics are made up of a grid of pixels. Each pixel contains specific color information, which collectively forms the image. Examples include photographs and digital paintings.
        </p>

  
        <p>Vector Graphics: Unlike raster graphics, vector graphics are based on mathematical equations and geometric shapes. They are resolution-independent, meaning they can be scaled without losing quality. Vector graphics are commonly used in logos, icons, and illustrations.
        </p>
 

<p>3D Graphics: 3D graphics involve the creation and manipulation of three-dimensional objects in a virtual environment. They are extensively used in video games, animated movies, virtual reality, and computer-aided design (CAD) applications.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In conclusion, data is an essential asset for organizations in today's digital world, and databases are critical for storing, managing, protecting, and analyzing data efficiently. The history of databases dates back to long before computers were invented, but the advent of computers marked the beginning of computerized databases. There are various types of databases available, including Relational, Object-Oriented, Hierarchical, and Network databases, each with unique benefits and suitable for different use cases. Organizations of all kinds and sizes use these databases to meet their information needs, track inventories, manage massive amounts of mission-critical customer information, and process eCommerce transactions.</p>
