# Superhero website
Hello world!

This is my first website, it's a project that was assigned to me by my IT teacher. It also holds a special place in my heart because it was my first project in the world of programming. I faced many challenges and struggled along the way. However, I'm proud to say that I persevered and succeeded in the end. 

For this assignment, our task was to select a superhero whom we deeply admire and create a website dedicated to them. After careful consideration, I chose Homura Akemi as my source of inspiration. Throughout my childhood and beyond, Homura Akemi has held a special place in my heart and has been a constant source of motivation for me.
