        <p>Hello, my name is Hanae and I am currently a student at H. Pius X-instituut. I am pursuing studies in accounting and computer science, and I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and skillset in these fields.
    
            In addition to my academic pursuits, I have many interests and hobbies. Reading is one of my passions, as it allows me to explore new worlds and expand my imagination. Recently, I have also taken an interest in Pilates, as well as other activities such as crochet, chess, and baking.
            
            This year has been a bit of a challenge for me, as I made the difficult decision to change my degree program in the middle of the year. In the first semester, I studied economics and math, but I discovered that math was not my forte and I struggled with it. However, I remained positive and believed that everything happens for a reason. As a result, I changed my degree program during the second semester and I'am now focusing on my studies and elevating myself.</p>

      <p>This is my first website, it's a project that was assigned to me by my IT teacher. It also holds a special place in my heart because it was my first project in the world of programming.
