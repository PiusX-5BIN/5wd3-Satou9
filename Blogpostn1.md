## Intro
In today's digital world data is more valuable than ever before. Data is the key to smooth functioning of everything. The succes of a company heavily depends on how well they will utilize their data, and this is where database comes into view, you need a databese or a place to store data. So what is database? and what different types of database are there?

## What is database
To understand what database is you firstly need to understand what data is. Dats can basically be evrything and anything any information or fact can be considerd as data such as your name, age, house adress..... and can aslo be in any form such as an image, file or a video any of this can be stored into a database. Database can be considerd as a container filled with data or informtion wich is electronically stored in a computer system. The reason why we store data in databases is so it can be easily accessed, protected and analyzed.

## Evolution of database
The history of databases dates back long before computers were invented. In the past, data was stored in journals, libraries, and filing cabinets, taking up space and making it difficult to find and back up. The advent of computers in the early 1960s marked the beginning of computerised databases. Charles Bachman designed the first database known as the Integrated Data Store. In the 1970s, E. F. Codd released "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks," which marked the beginning of the relational database. The history of databases is a rich and evolving one that has been impacted by the advancements of technology and the need to manage and protect large amounts of data efficiently and effectively.

## Types of Databases

They are a lot of types of databases with different benefits, but in this articl I will cover just the 4 most important databses:

1.Relational Database
A relational database is a kind of database that stores and gives access to data points related to each other. It is based on the relational model and a precise data representation in tables. Each row in the table is documented with a particular ID called the key in a relational database. 

Benefits of a relational database management system

Organizations of all kinds and sizes use the robust relational model for different information needs. Relational databases are used to track inventories, manage massive amounts of mission-critical customer information, and process eCommerce transactions.

2.Object-Oriented Database(OOD)
Object-oriented databases(OOD) emerged to meet the need to couple object-oriented programming languages with a database. 

3.Hierarchical Database
As the name implies, the hierarchical database model is most suitable for use cases. The primary focus of information assemblage is based on a definite hierarchy, such as several respective employees reporting to a single department at a firm.

4.The network Database
The network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their relationships. Its distinguishing feature is that the schema, viewed as a graph in which object types are nodes and relationship types are arcs, is not restricted to being a hierarchy or lattice.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, data is an essential asset for organizations in today's digital world, and databases are critical for storing, managing, protecting, and analyzing data efficiently. The history of databases dates back to long before computers were invented, but the advent of computers marked the beginning of computerized databases. There are various types of databases available, including Relational, Object-Oriented, Hierarchical, and Network databases, each with unique benefits and suitable for different use cases. Organizations of all kinds and sizes use these databases to meet their information needs, track inventories, manage massive amounts of mission-critical customer information, and process eCommerce transactions.
