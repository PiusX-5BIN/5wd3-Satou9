      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p>In today's digital world, data is more valuable than ever before. Data is the key to the smooth functioning of
        everything. The success of a company heavily depends on how well they utilize their data, and this is where
        databases come into view. You need a database or a place to store data. So what is a database? And what
        different types of databases are there?</p>

      <h3>What is a Database</h3>
      <p>To understand what a database is, you firstly need to understand what data is. Data can basically be everything
        and anything; any information or fact can be considered as data, such as your name, age, house address, and can
        also be in any form, such as an image, file, or video. Any of this can be stored into a database. A database can
        be considered as a container filled with data or information which is electronically stored in a computer
        system. The reason why we store data in databases is so it can be easily accessed, protected, and analyzed.</p>

      <h3>Evolution of Databases</h3>
      <p>The history of databases dates back long before computers were invented. In the past, data was stored in
        journals, libraries, and filing cabinets, taking up space and making it difficult to find and back up. The
        advent of computers in the early 1960s marked the beginning of computerized databases. Charles Bachman designed
        the first database known as the Integrated Data Store. In the 1970s, E. F. Codd released "A Relational Model of
        Data for Large Shared Data Banks," which marked the beginning of the relational database. The history of
        databases is a rich and evolving one that has been impacted by the advancements of technology and the need to
        manage and protect large amounts of data efficiently and effectively.</p>

      <h3>Types of Databases</h3>

      <p>There are a lot of types of databases with different benefits, but in this article, I will cover just the 4
        most important databases:</p>

      <ol>
        <li class="black">
          <strong>Relational Database:</strong>
          <p>A relational database is a kind of database that stores and gives access to data points related to each
            other. It is based on the relational model and a precise data representation in tables. Each row in the
            table is documented with a particular ID called the key in a relational database.</p>
          <p><em>Benefits of a relational database management system:</em></p>
          <ul>
            <li class="black">Organizations of all kinds and sizes use the robust relational model for different
              information needs.</li>
            <li class="black">Relational databases are used to track inventories, manage massive amounts of
              mission-critical customer information, and process eCommerce transactions.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="black">
          <strong>Object-Oriented Database (OOD):</strong>
          <p>Object-oriented databases (OOD) emerged to meet the need to couple object-oriented programming languages
            with a database.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="black">
          <strong>Hierarchical Database:</strong>
          <p>As the name implies, the hierarchical database model is most suitable for use cases where the primary focus
            of information assemblage is based on a definite hierarchy, such as several respective employees reporting
            to a single department at a firm.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="black">
          <strong>The Network Database:</strong>
          <p>The network model is a database model conceived as a flexible way of representing objects and their
            relationships. Its distinguishing feature is that the schema, viewed as a graph in which object types are
            nodes and relationship types are arcs, is not restricted to being a hierarchy or lattice.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>In conclusion, data is an essential asset for organizations in today's digital world, and databases are
        critical for storing, managing, protecting, and analyzing data efficiently. The history of databases dates back
        to long before computers were invented, but the advent of computers marked the beginning of computerized
        databases. There are various types of databases available, including Relational, Object-Oriented, Hierarchical,
        and Network databases, each with unique benefits and suitable for different use cases. Organizations of all
        kinds and sizes use these databases to meet their information needs, track inventories, manage massive amounts
        of mission-critical customer information, and process eCommerce transactions.</p>
