# Computer graphics

Graphics refer to sketches, drawings, or specialized networks that visually convey meaningful information. Computer Graphics involves manipulating sets of images or creating pixel-based images on a computer. It finds applications in digital photography, film, entertainment, electronic devices, and other essential technologies. This field, encompassing various aspects, is extensive within computer science. Computer Graphics finds application in UI design, rendering, geometric objects, animation, and more. In many contexts, Computer Graphics is abbreviated as CG. Several tools are utilized for implementing Computer Graphics, including the fundamental <graphics.h> header file in Turbo-C, the advanced Unity framework, and even OpenGL.

## There are several types of graphics commonly used in various fields. Here are some of the main types:

Raster Graphics: Also known as bitmap graphics, these graphics are made up of a grid of pixels. Each pixel contains specific color information, which collectively forms the image. Examples include photographs and digital paintings.

Vector Graphics: Unlike raster graphics, vector graphics are based on mathematical equations and geometric shapes. They are resolution-independent, meaning they can be scaled without losing quality. Vector graphics are commonly used in logos, icons, and illustrations.

3D Graphics: 3D graphics involve the creation and manipulation of three-dimensional objects in a virtual environment. They are extensively used in video games, animated movies, virtual reality, and computer-aided design (CAD) applications.

Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI): CGI refers to the use of computer graphics to create or enhance visual elements in movies, television shows, and advertisements. It involves combining live-action footage with computer-generated elements to produce realistic or fantastical scenes.

Infographics: Infographics are visual representations of data, information, or knowledge. They often combine text, charts, graphs, and illustrations to present complex information in a concise and engaging manner.

Motion Graphics: Motion graphics involve the use of animation and visual effects to create visually appealing and dynamic graphics. They are commonly seen in title sequences, commercials, and multimedia presentations.

Interactive Graphics: Interactive graphics allow users to interact with the graphics, typically through user interfaces. Examples include video games, augmented reality (AR), and user interface designs.

These are just a few examples, and there are many more specialized types of graphics based on specific applications and technologies.
