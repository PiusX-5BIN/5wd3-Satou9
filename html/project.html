      <h1>My first project</h1>
      <h3>Superhero Website</h3>
      <p>This is my first website, it's a project that was assigned to me by my IT teacher. It also holds a special
        place in my heart because it was my first project in the world of programming. I faced many challenges and
        struggled along the way. However, I'm proud to say that I persevered and succeeded in the end.
      </p>
      <p>For this assignment, our task was to select a superhero whom we deeply admire and create a website dedicated to
        them. After careful consideration, I chose Homura Akemi as my source of inspiration. Throughout my childhood and
        beyond, Homura Akemi has held a special place in my heart and has been a constant source of motivation for me.
